Original nopixel 4.0 emotes (Animation Menu) script.

The server side has been rewritten.
np-base and qbCore version are attached.
(In the nopixel version, you can replace the "np-db" script on the server side with "ghmattimysql" or "oxmysql")

You need a few scripts for installation. You can download them yourself from the "dump" or edit the export of the necessary scripts.
